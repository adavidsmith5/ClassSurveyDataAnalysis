# ClassSurveyDataAnalysis
Using Python to analyze student responses to a survey to be given weekly.

At this point I have used Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to clean, analyze, and visualize data I mocked up. I will be adding front-end UI to the project 
based on feedback from coworkers and what they would want to be able to do and see.
